1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,137
How many have ordered
DVDs and haven't paid?

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,616
Claire. Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,674
I could stop by on my way
to school. It's really important.

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:13,194
Um... Uh, Cheryl,
can I call you back?

5
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:16,331
Okay. Great. Bye.
Yes, Phil. What?

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,095
I was going through your drawer in
the bathroom looking for some lip stuff...

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,880
'cause my... Lips were dry.

8
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:22,904
God, you know me. Phil.

9
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:26,041
Remember the spa certificates we
got at the children's hospital auction?

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,061
Mm-hmm. Well, look at
this. They expire tomorrow.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,430
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

12
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:34,210
Claire, I don't think you're grasping
the magnitude of this package...

13
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,050
valued at over $250.

14
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,070
- Sweetie...
- If you don't use 'em,

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,250
then all our money
just goes to charity.

16
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,658
What am I supposed to do? Somewhere
between dropping off Alex at orchestra...

17
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:45,405
and picking up
Luke from practice...

18
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:47,729
Oh, and burning a bunch
of DVDs of the talent show...

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,548
I'm gonna, what, pop
in for a quick salt scrub?

20
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,512
I thought Cheryl
was doing the DVDs.

21
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:55,103
She's supposed to, but
somehow she's got me doing it.

22
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:58,602
Here's what you do. You
say, "Cheryl, no can do today.

23
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,593
Need a little me time."
Have you met Cheryl?

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,563
That'll be my new nickname. I'll be Claire
"Me Time" Dunphy. It's not worth the headache.

25
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,728
Just say you're sick. Then I'll run
into her and it'll be a whole thing.

26
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,214
If that happens, say you were
on your way to the pharmacy.

27
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,038
Phil, darling, no. Not helping.

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,067
Fine. I'll give them to
Florence Gunderman at work.

29
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:18,326
Her hands are gross ever
since she took up the banjo.

30
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,740
Hey, Mom, I need some money
for lunch. We're all gonna go...

31
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:22,975
Oh, my God! Take off my
sweater! Mom, tell her to take it off!

32
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,516
Alex, take it off.

33
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,719
Last week she wore my sweatshirt
without asking. That is true.

34
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,440
Oh, please, that was an honor
for your stupid old sweatshirt.

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,586
It was the first time the
top half got any exercise.

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,889
Now, Mom, that's my
favorite sweater. I just got it.

37
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:40,059
You know what you girls need to
learn to do? You need to learn to share.

38
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,145
Because that's what sisters do.

39
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,581
All right, Haley, nothing's
gonna happen to your sweater.

40
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,605
Right, Alex? Hmm?

41
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,156
Okay, fine.

42
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:51,559
Then I will just go put on
your favorite nerdy T-shirt,

43
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,413
the one with the guy from<i>
Back to the Future</i> on it.

44
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:58,000
That's Albert Einstein.
And it is not nerdy.

45
00:01:58,936 --> 00:01:59,976
Well...

46
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,938
Hi.

47
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,985
- Hey, Daddy. How was
the farmer's market?
- Well, it was great.

48
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,143
- But guess what
the new spinach is.
- Um, radicchio?

49
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,663
- Kale.
- No!

50
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,798
I know. I was just as
blown away as you are.

51
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,003
Oh! Well, I guess we're
going to have to adopt... yay...

52
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,549
A new attitude towards kale.

53
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,557
Maybe we'll even
adopt... a new vinaigrette.

54
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,126
Adopt. Yay!

55
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,261
Okay, what's going on here?

56
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,431
I'm taking the negative charge
out of the word "adopted." Yay.

57
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:30,865
What did Oprah do now?

58
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:34,786
She had a girl on who at 16
found out that she was adopted,

59
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,000
and felt betrayed and ran
away and became a stripper,

60
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:39,552
and not the heart-of-gold
kind, the by-the-airport kind.

61
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,292
Okay.

62
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,373
All right, go get your
gavel, Judge Judy.

63
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,998
No, not at all. I'm
adopting... Ah...

64
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,334
A tolerant attitude toward
your flights of lunacy.

65
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,420
Adopting! Yay!

66
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,456
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

67
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,558

71
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,836
Alex, come on. Hurry up. The later
we are, the more Cheryl texts me to do.

72
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,204
I'm coming. I'm coming.

73
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,524
Tell me again why the violin
just wasn't you. It's too happy.

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,423
Oh, my God. Okay, hang on.
Hang on. Hang on. Let's see.

75
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,983
It might not be a big deal.
Here we go. Let's see. Oh! Okay.

76
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,219
Is it bad? No,
it's gonna be fine.

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,837
You're gonna be okay.

78
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,422
Oh, honey.

79
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,991
Hey, I forgot my phone. Hi.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,427
What? Nothing. I love you.

81
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,948
So weird. You better not spill
anything on that. Okay, dork?

82
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,200
Relax. Half the 11th grade's
been inside this sweater.

83
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,713
<i>More than anything,</i>

84
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,772
I want my girls to stop
fighting and be close.

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,442
I want them to share clothes and do
each other's hair and gossip about boys,

86
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,511
like I used to do with Mitchell.

87
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:54,249
Gloria, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

88
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,885
Hey, Jay, have you
noticed a spring in my step?

89
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,771
Oh, kids say cruel things. That
doesn't mean you'll turn out that way.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,741
No. We have something in
common. I'm seeing a younger woman.

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,222
- How much younger
are we talking about?
- Thirteen months.

92
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,745
Her name's Chloe.

93
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,426
- She makes me feel
like a fifth grader again.
- Good for you, kid.

94
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,803
Mmm. There they are...
My two dirty old men.

95
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,822
Hey, pretty soon you're
gonna be north of 40,

96
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,902
and I'm gonna have to trade
you in for a newer model.

97
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,843
Am I right, buddy?
That's my mother, Jay.

98
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,511
You ready?

99
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,614
It's such a beautiful day.
Why do we have to do this?

100
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,968
Because when this thing is behind
us, we never have to think about it again.

101
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,436
Come on.

102
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,171
I went to a funeral
last Saturday,

103
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,253
and it got me thinking about where Gloria
and I were gonna end up after we die.

104
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,412
Yeah, it's been a fun week. I don't
like loose ends. So I made a few calls.

105
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,332
I found these people selling a couple of
primo plots in the best cemetery in town.

106
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:46,334
Not that I'm gonna
go there anytime soon.

107
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,003
Don't be so sure.

108
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:50,150
With all that
bacon that he eats.

109
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:52,957
Well, I gotta give my
cholesterol pills something to do.

110
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,328
Mmm. Mmm. I don't care
how much they promote it.

111
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,243
Kale is a garnish. It's not
ready to anchor a meal.

112
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,533
Look at this. Oh, my God!

113
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,348
Lily's little hat that we bought
her at the airport in Vietnam.

114
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,767
Remember how cute she looked?
Remember how I used to wear it...

115
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,136
and walk around and act like
I had a giant head? Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,260
That was good acting. Oh!

117
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,881
What are you doing? I'm putting together
a scrapbook of how Lily became ours.

118
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,117
Her adoption certificates and
pictures of her from her village,

119
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,353
all out in the open, so she
has nothing to be ashamed of.

120
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,590
You leaving that on all day? And
I'm also gonna write a little storybook,

121
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,960
something I can read her at bedtime...
called "Two Monkeys and a Panda."

122
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,056
Oh. She's the panda
because she's Asian.

123
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,664
And we're monkeys
because... I can draw monkeys.

124
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,384
Okay. Well, I think
this is a great project,

125
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,903
and I believe you
are gonna finish it.

126
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,256
Oh, my God! What?

127
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:43,024
Lily's adoption certificate.

128
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,555
Her name is Lily
Tucker Pritchett. Right.

129
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,164
Not Tucker-hyphen-Pritchett
like it's supposed to be.

130
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:53,151
First name, Lily. Middle name,
Tucker. Last name, Pritchett.

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,972
Well, that can't be right.
This is a legal document.

132
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,141
She only has your last name.
My name's just a middle name.

133
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,161
Stay calm. Don't get upset. Nobody
knows anyone's middle name.

134
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,774
Quick. What's my
middle name? Scott.

135
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,483
Of course you know mine. We're a
couple. This is obviously a mistake.

136
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,852
But you're the one who
filled out this paperwork.

137
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,773
You don't make mistakes like
this. You correct mistakes like this.

138
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,775
You did this on purpose.

139
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,327
What?

140
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,330
You buried my name so your
name could have top billing.

141
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:26,334
No, I am not gonna sit here and listen to
you accuse me of something so horrible.

142
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,703
It makes so much sense now...

143
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:31,423
why you wanted to fill
out all these legal forms.

144
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,170
Well, I'm a lawyer. I fill
out all the legal forms...

145
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,861
ever since you signed up for
a 12-year gym membership.

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,913
The more you spend,
the more you save.

147
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,805
All the women at work were
too busy to use the certificates.

148
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,825
So I called the spa and asked
them to extend the expiration date.

149
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:54,362
But they said no. Really?

150
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:57,065
Here's something
they didn't count on:

151
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,435
You mess with Phil
Dunphy, the claws come out.

152
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,541
You have very nice
hands. Soft like lady's.

153
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,944
Thank you, Kim.
I appreciate that.

154
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,647
My wife never seems to notice.

155
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,821
This is it. Ta-da!

156
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,473
What is "ta-da"?

157
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,908
I'm just saying
this is it. Ta-da.

158
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,638
"Ta-da" is when you do a flip,

159
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,997
or where the magician
cuts the pretty lady in half,

160
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,500
not when you show someone where
you want to shove their dead body.

161
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm not gonna argue the
proper use of "ta-da." This is it.

162
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,439
Seriously? In the file cabinet?

163
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:41,642
It's called a crypt. And how are
you not getting how great this is?

164
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,628
We're four down
from Bugsy Siegel.

165
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,931
No. I'm not going into any
wall. I'm going in the ground.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,785
Sorry. Not me. There's enough not to like
about death without adding dirt and worms.

167
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,787
The whole thing
gives me the willies.

168
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:55,023
You die, you go to the ground.

169
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,442
It's natural. You
go back to the earth.

170
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,639
Here you're just a
mushy bag of bones...

171
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,783
rotting away for all eternity.

172
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,551
Sorry for your loss.

173
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,203
Can we get the hell out of here?

174
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,356
What am I supposed
to tell the guy?

175
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,627
Tell them we don't want our bodies inside
these drawers where God cannot find us.

176
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:19,114
These are not like our drawers at
home. People can find things in these.

177
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,549
I'm thinking of getting bangs.

178
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:25,070
Ooh, you totally should. You
would be so cute with bangs.

179
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,872
You have the
face for it. I don't.

180
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,357
Oh, there's my better
half. Kim, would you mind?

181
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,755
Thank you. You're welcome.

182
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,047
- Hey, honey, where are you?
- Oh, I'm on my way to Downey.

183
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:39,284
Oh. Did you know Karen and
Richard Carpenter grew up in Downey?

184
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,520
<i>What a random and
not helpful fact, Phil.</i>

185
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,256
I'm sorry. I'm having
kind of a rough day.

186
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,536
Yeah, I'm kind of having
a rough day myself.

187
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,013
Look, Phil, I need you to
take care of dinner for me.

188
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,328
<i>What's wrong?</i> Alex ripped
Haley's favorite sweater,

189
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,396
and now I'm driving
around from store to store...

190
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,532
trying to find the exact same
one before Haley finds out.

191
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:02,117
Don't do that. Just explain
to her what happened.

192
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,787
- Uh-uh. Haley's not
gonna understand.
- Sure, she will.

193
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,811
No, Phil, you don't understand.

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,180
I'm trying to avoid this
turning into a whole big thing.

195
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,111
Then just get her something close.
She'll never know the difference.

196
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,386
Phil, could you just take care of
dinner, sweetie? That's all I'm asking.

197
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,883
I'm just saying there's
a simpler way to do this.

198
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,586
There is no simpler way.
Just make dinner. Thank you.

199
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,050
Hello?

200
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,898
What?

201
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,251
Mr. Pritchett!

202
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,621
We're the Rutledges,
the ones selling the spots.

203
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,423
Hi. Hi.

204
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,486
Oh, my gosh. Look, honey.

205
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,944
I hadn't heard.

206
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,445
Martin is in.

207
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,482
Well, look at that. I'm sorry.
Is that a friend of yours?

208
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,430
We've made a point to get to
know everyone in the neighborhood.

209
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,616
We think it makes it less
awkward, you know, later.

210
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,701
Oh, I'm sorry. This
is my wife, Gloria.

211
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,592
Oh.

212
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,663
I'm Ed, and this is my bunk.

213
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:03,434
And this is my loving wife and
devoted mother of three, Winnie.

214
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,671
She'll be here. Well, I don't
know what our lineup is yet.

215
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,608
But at home I sleep on the
right side, so probably there.

216
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:15,580
We don't mean to be rude, but you seem
to be much younger than your husband.

217
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,127
You're not rude. I'm very much
younger. Is that a problem?

218
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,312
Well, it's just that
there's a good chance...

219
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,204
you'll be moving in
long before she would.

220
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,674
Our concern is,
your wife remarries,

221
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,238
and she wants to be laid to
rest with her new husband.

222
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,197
So she sells this spot
to the highest bidder.

223
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,765
And we're left lying next
to a complete stranger...

224
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,268
without even so much as
a formal "how do you do?"

225
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,365
Gloria, tell them you're in.

226
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,989
I don't know, Jay.

227
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,324
I think they have
a very good point.

228
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,360
And they're not crazy at all.

229
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,406
What do you mean
they have a good point?

230
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,364
I don't think this
is going to work.

231
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,866
Good luck getting
someone into your drawers.

232
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:01,609
It occurs to me that I may
have gotten a little too upset...

233
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:05,446
and jumped to some conclusions
that were perhaps not true.

234
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,047
I realize now...

235
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:12,303
that you would never intentionally
do something so unthinkable, so...

236
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,023
I just wanted to say I'm
sorry for accusing you.

237
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,126
- I did it.
- I knew it. You two-faced...

238
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:21,662
- Let me explain.
- There... There is no explanation.

239
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,632
There is just no excuse.
I just wanna know why.

240
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:29,971
Okay. You know how some women
say they forget how painful childbirth was?

241
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,542
Well, I-I think that you were forgetting
how panicked you were before we got Lily.

242
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,195
- You were freaking out.
- I was not.

243
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,932
So it says that we can put the
mattress at one of three different levels.

244
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,979
Which one should
we do? I don't know.

245
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,043
Well, just think about how
far down she should be...

246
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,545
I don't know. I can't do this!

247
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,044
Okay. Oh, this
latch system's great.

248
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,013
What did people do before this? I
don't know. Stop asking me questions.

249
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:59,550
Cam... I can't do this. I can't.

250
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,903
Well, I... I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

251
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,591
I was scared that it was just
gonna all be too much for you...

252
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,637
and that you were gonna leave,

253
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,229
and then I would be the
one taking care of a baby,

254
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,932
and half of her last name would
belong to the guy who left us.

255
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,485
It was a mistake. I'm sorry.

256
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:21,033
I wanted to have it changed,
but I needed to get your signature,

257
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:24,625
and I was afraid that it would start a
big fight and that you would hate me...

258
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,812
Okay, I'm confused. You're saying
that if she tells me she has a problem,

259
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,172
I'm not supposed to help her?
Not unless she asks for your help.

260
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,907
But if she lets me help her, I
can make her problem go away.

261
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,188
Oh! That is such
a male thing to say.

262
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,797
Well, forgive me
for being a man. Mm.

263
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,800
Mango or kiwi? Ooh, kiwi.

264
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,685
When you say,
"Do this or do that,"

265
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,455
all she's hearing is,
"I'm smarter than you."

266
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,668
Believe me, she
doesn't think that. Mm.

267
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,060
She doesn't want you
to solve her problems.

268
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,106
She just wants you
to give her support...

269
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,108
so that she can solve
her problems herself.

270
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:07,402
Yes, and sometimes... sometimes
she just wants a sympathetic ear.

271
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,338
Whoa. Whoa. Oh, yes. Mm-hmm.

272
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,352
Maybe it's all the creams, but
that just made sense, girlfriends.

273
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,893
Okay, yeah. So if Claire says,

274
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,895
"I hate getting
stuck in traffic,"

275
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,144
I shouldn't say, "Maybe
you should leave earlier."

276
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,212
No. Or, "Don't get
on the freeway."

277
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,871
I should just say, "I
know. It's so frustrating."

278
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,440
Yes, that's it. Really? Yes!

279
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,478
And if she says, "The waiter
I had today was so rude,"

280
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,824
I shouldn't say, "Maybe you
should have just ordered...

281
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,848
something on the
menu for once." No.

282
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,552
I should just say,
"What a jerk."

283
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,053
Yes! Yes!

284
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,034
And if she says, "Phil,
the TV's driving me crazy,"

285
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:49,060
I should just say, "I know. There is not
enough quality programming for women."

286
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,380
No. Turn off the damn
TV. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

287
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,865
Okay, now I'm confused again.

288
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,804
- So I heard you had
a rough time today.
- Yeah, well...

289
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,084
Remember the days when
we thought we'd live forever?

290
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:05,309
Don't you wanna go
play? When do I ever play?

291
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,190
I'm kind of wrestling with this whole
older man, younger woman thing.

292
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,425
It's like Chloe and I grew
up in different worlds.

293
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,684
Today I made a joke about the
Wiggles. It went right over her head.

294
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:17,354
I don't know what that is. It's an
expression. It means she didn't get it.

295
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,660
Yeah, sometimes this age
thing knocks you in the head.

296
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,246
Is that what this is about?

297
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,683
I always knew your mother might remarry
after I'm gone. That never bothered me.

298
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,352
I figured her husbands
would be your dad, me...

299
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:34,155
and some putz who
could never live up to me.

300
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,190
But what if I'm
not the main guy?

301
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,194
What if some other guy
is? What if I'm the putz?

302
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,308
When my mom and
dad got divorced,

303
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,943
do you have any idea how
many guys chased after her?

304
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,087
The phone didn't stop ringing.

305
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,981
Men would stop
her on the street.

306
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,238
Guys would propose
to her from moving cars.

307
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,086
And they were good-looking
guys, Jay, with money.

308
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,656
I think one of them was a Kennedy.
Where are you going with this?

309
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,625
When you showed up, I
didn't think you had a prayer.

310
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,428
You were so nervous and
sweaty, I felt sorry for you.

311
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:04,385
I had to climb
three flights of stairs.

312
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:08,106
- But of all people,
my mom fell for you.
- I've got a few moves.

313
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,619
She said she fell in love
with you during your first fight.

314
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,277
What? She said she'd
finally met her match.

315
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,478
Huh.

316
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,560
So if you think she's just gonna
replace you when you're gone,

317
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,579
then you<i> are</i> the putz.

318
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,953
Thanks, kid. I appreciate that.

319
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,485
I thought you liked me when
I first showed up. Please.

320
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,309
For the first month, I didn't
even bother to learn your name.

321
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,709
Is she back yet?
She's on her way.

322
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,717
Did you find it? I did...
at the fifth store I went to.

323
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:40,188
It was in the window, and I had to undress
a mannequin while a creepy guy filmed it,

324
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:42,289
so we have that to look
forward to on the Internet.

325
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,442
Thank you so much,
Mom. You're welcome.

326
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,045
Now go put that exactly where
you found the other one, okay?

327
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,612
Okay. Mwah.

328
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,898
Uh-oh.

329
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,944
What? The security
tag, it's still on.

330
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,946
I told those people
to take that off.

331
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,216
Oh, no. She's pulling
into the driveway!

332
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,518
Okay, it's fine. It's fine.
Don't panic. I've got it.

333
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,853
She's getting out of
the car! I am doing it.

334
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,123
- I've almost got it. Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

335
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,297
- What is that?
- Well, it's ink.

336
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,032
Hide it.

337
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,617
She's in the house!

338
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,464
What are you doing with my
sweater? Oh, my God! It's ruined!

339
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:15,556
- It was an accident.
- I knew this would happen. You idiot!

340
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,669
Hey, hey. Let's
try to get along.

341
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,627
I wish she was never even born.

342
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:22,329
They were trying to
make one with a brain.

343
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,398
Ah! Ah!

344
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:27,568
Honey, you guys are
both... pretty smart.

345
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:30,971
Ah. Sheesh.

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
It's that sweater, huh?

347
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,920
Yeah, it is that sweater.

348
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,678
And I did everything I can
to stop them from fighting.

349
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,348
I don't understand why they
can't see how much you love them.

350
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,585
I don't know. Meanwhile, Cheryl
has been calling me all day...

351
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:46,699
because she's
angry I didn't show up.

352
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:50,825
Doesn't Cheryl have a housekeeper and a
nanny? Why does she need so much help?

353
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,526
I know, right?

354
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,595
You work so hard.

355
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,664
You do so much.

356
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,532
I do.

357
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,802
Of course you do. I do.

358
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,504
I do.

359
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,909
Oh, sweetie, thank you.
I really appreciate that.

360
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,664
Hey. Yeah?

361
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,499
Who's my gal?

362
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,168
I am. Darn right.

363
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,747
Yeah.

364
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,754
Let me get this.

365
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:24,975
Hey, by the way, do you notice
anything different about me?

366
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,044
Uh-uh.

367
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,546
Huh.

368
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,247
Hmm. What is it?

369
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,715
Nothing.

370
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,934
A haircut. A week ago.

371
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,769
Okay, so tell me.

372
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,688
Forget it. It's not important.

373
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,224
Okay. I'll just go start dinner.

374
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,211
Listen, I've been thinking.

375
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:49,216
When I go, I want you to know...

376
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:51,369
it's okay if you
marry someone else.

377
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,854
I know.

378
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:56,690
Because I want you to
be happy. I'll be happy.

379
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,820
You're driving me
crazy on purpose, right?

380
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,944
Jay, I'm not going
to marry anyone else.

381
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,908
That's what you say now. But no
one knows what the future holds.

382
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,100
So I want you to have this.

383
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,168
<i>Ay,</i> look at this.

384
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,371
An empty coffee can.

385
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,540
Do you know what
men used to buy me?

386
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,342
When I go, toss me in the fire,

387
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,861
sweep up my ashes,
stick 'em in that.

388
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,530
Ta-da!

389
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,999
We need to talk
about this "ta-da."

390
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,454
'Cause I don't care if it's in
a wall or if it's in the ground,

391
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,757
just as long as I
end up with you.

392
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,926
Aw, Jay.

393
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,481
It's perfect. Jay Pritchett
sitting on the mantel...

394
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,350
in the old coffee can.

395
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,669
That will drive the putz
crazy, and I like that.

396
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,327
Hey.

397
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,480
Um, so for whatever it's worth,

398
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,051
I called the adoption
attorney... adoption, yay...

399
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,269
And on Monday they're
gonna start the process...

400
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,590
of changing Lily's last
name to Tucker-Pritchett.

401
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,291
Great.

402
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,511
Again, I'm... I'm so sorry.

403
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,781
Okay.

404
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,719
Um... Oh, I, uh...

405
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:18,389
I took a quick pass at "Two
Monkeys and a Panda."

406
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,674
So just let me
know what you think.

407
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,845
"Once upon a time
there were two monkeys.

408
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,732
They loved each other very much,
but there was something missing."

409
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,850
A hyphen?

410
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,753
"They wanted a baby.

411
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,323
And they heard that there was a
very special baby in a faraway land...

412
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,058
who needed a family.

413
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,495
She was a panda named Lily.

414
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,530
One of the monkeys was scared.

415
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,550
They'd never had a panda before.

416
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,219
But they held
Lily in their arms,

417
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,388
and the scared monkey
became the brave one.

418
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,075
And the two monkeys"...
Coco and Miko.

419
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:57,890
- I'm sorry. What?
- Coco and Miko are
the names of the monkeys.

420
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:01,148
Really? That doesn't
seem like it's a little...

421
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:04,951
Coco and Miko. I
like that. I like that.

422
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,053
Coco and Miko. Yeah.

423
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:12,058
"They traveled all the way home with
the perfect panda that they adopted."

424
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,408
Did she just clap? She
heard "adopted" and clapped.

425
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,565
Cam, that's amazing.

426
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,369
Oh, my God. You did that.

427
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,238
Wha... You did
that. That is amazing.

428
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,956
I can't believe that.

429
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,476
And just like that, peace
returned to our house.

430
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,513
Well, technically,
it's my house, but...

431
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,449
I-I will... I will fix that too.

432
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,372
Once we finished writing the
book, we realized something.

433
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,687
We're not the only two
monkeys with a panda.

434
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,079
Gay parents are a huge market,
and no one's writing for them.

435
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:51,165
We thought we were
sitting on a gold mine.

436
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,699
But we weren't.

437
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,098
Let's see. Oh.

438
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,188
"Gay Parenting." Oh.

439
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,402
"Gay Adoptive Parenting." Okay.

440
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,805
"Gay Adoption
Foreign Children." Wow.

441
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,173
"Gay Adoption Asian
Children." What?

442
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,898
"Bisexual Adoption
Asian Children." Oh!

443
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,001
"Transgendered Adoption."

444
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:13,429
Okay, come on. Let's go, Miko.

445
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,294
English - US - Line 21
